# goldtest

This is a quick header-only extension that provides definitions for google test for testing files generated by code against expected output gold files.

## Dependencies

- googletest
- [dtl](https://github.com/cubicdaiya/dtl) diff template library

## Usage
1. Place the `goldtest` folder in your include path.
2. Run your code that generates your test file.
3. Use the macro `EXPECT_GOLD_FILE_MATCH(actual_file_location, gold_file_location)` to run the test.

Note that the current state of this will not delete generated test files or move
gold files to an appropriate location. See the `CMakeLists.txt` in the example and testing 
folder for an example of how to recursively find and move gold files to a particular 
directory for testing.
